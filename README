Readme file for 8-bit Assembler and Simulator

This is the source for my 8-bit Assembler and Simulator. Currently, only
the 6502 and the Intel mcs-51 family are supported currently. The 6502
is alpha, but the mcs-51 back end will be actively worked on.

The source will work for gnu tools (gcc, gmake, etc), but I have tried
not to use features that are unique to the gnu tools. Similarly, the 
library calls should be ANSI and POSIX standard, but your mileage may
vary on a non Linux system.

To build the tools, check out the source and at the root directory and type: 

	make "CC=gcc -O"

In the cygwin environment <http://www.cygwin.com> you can build win32 native 
tools (doesn't need the cygwin.dll) with the command:

	make "CC=gcc -O -mno-cygwin"

The processor specific assembler and simulator will be in the processor
directories. Run asm -h to get help for the assembler or enter h as a command 
in the simulator.
