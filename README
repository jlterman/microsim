Readme file for 8-bit Assembler and Simulator

This is the source for my 8-bit Assembler and Simulator. Currently, only
the 6502 and the Intel MC-51 family are supported currenly. The 6502
is alpha, but the MC-51 backend will be actively worked on.

The source will work for gnu tools (gcc, gmake, etc), but I have tried
not to use features that are unique to the gnu tools. Similarly, the 
library calls should be ANSI and POSIX standard, but your mileage may
vary on a non Linux system.

To build the tools, check out the source and at the root 
type: make "CC=gcc -O"

The processor specific assembler and simulator will be in the processor
directories (asm51 will be intel8051 and sim6502 will be in m6502). Run
asm -h to get help for the assembler or enter h as a command in the 
simulator.

Any bugs, patches or feature suggestions can be sent to me at
